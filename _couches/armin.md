I've got a spare huge old used couch in my living room, it's a bit loud here thanks to a police station near my house, but my fridge usually offers cool beer. I also have a good stereo, it's 3min to the Main and one could chill there nicely in summer. Central railway station 7min by feet, city 10min by feet, you literally get anywhere from here easily.

Email me if you happen to need a cool place for the night! We're up for open discussion rounds, pub visits, discotheques and chilling out there, too, of course.

I love to use Linux and BSD operating systems. You're welcome with any operating system, though, of course. ;-)
