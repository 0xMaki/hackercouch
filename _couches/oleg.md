I live in central Berlin (`Mitte` border of `Prenzlauer Berg`).
Like `IOT`, `NLP`, `Machine Learning` `Robotics`, `JavaScript`, `Python` and automation.
Have an extra double-bed couch, and another tv couch as well
as a camping mattress.
Will love to host for purposes of mutual learning and development.
