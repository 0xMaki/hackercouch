I sleep on a small mat in the living room, so my bed is always available to visitors. It's a king-sized mattress and can comfortably accomodate two people. My flat has one bathroom, a balcony, a large refrigerator, a gas stove, a desk, a table, and plenty of tea. Oh. And wifi.

I practice Zero Waste. This means all garbage in my house falls into two categories: clean/washed dry waste (paper, plastic, metal, glass) and compost. For this reason I do not cook meat at home and I do not have food delivered. Hopefully guests do not find these restrictions too inconvenient.

Local ameneties include a supermarket, drycleaner, tailor, a few restaurants, and a couple coffee shops / cafes. Cooke Town is primarily residential which means it's quiet... but not that convenient. :)
