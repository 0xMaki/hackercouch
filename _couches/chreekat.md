I am a Haskell and web developer, pedal tramp, letter writer, and hill
runner. I am currently stationary for a little while and I welcome you all
to my 1-room studio. It's not big, but it's comfortable, and it's in a good
place for exploring Portland.

I am currently working on [Snowdrift.coop](https://snowdrift.coop), trying
to make the world a better place by encouraging and supporting
free/libre/open software.

:)
