### Modern nomad, an activist and a friend.

I’m a lot on the road, it’s in my nature. Often I hitchhike. I consider myself as a modern vagabond or nomad. I can do my work from anywhere and sometimes I’m not doing paid work for long times.

I'm a thinker, maker & activist.

I like building stuff, be it from wood or code.

Techie, [working](http://www.mikaelkorpela.fi/volunteering/) most of my time on open source & non-profit travel projects (I co-founded [Trustroots](https://www.trustroots.org/), I work on [Hitchwiki](http://hitchwiki.org/) / [Nomadwiki](http://nomadwiki.org/) / [Trashwiki](http://trashwiki.org/) and bunch of other stuff).

I enjoy a company of positive and talkative people.
Don’t be evil. Be yourself.

I have a good tolerance for different people and behaviour.
You can be odd if you want to.

I live with [Simona](http://www.wanderlust.lt/).

I get a ton of people writing to me and asking to be hosted. By all means do contact me! I just tend to host only hitchhikers, cyclists, geeks, activists, long term nomads, tramps and other inspiring folk. You probably know if you're one. ;-)

We're often out of Vilnius and we don't plan much ahead; I don't usually know what are my plans many weeks ahead. Last minute messages are great!

Often heading to the countryside at the weekends.

I love cycling, coffee, sauna, inspiring music, any food I didn't try yet. Well I love good food. Great food. Mostly vegetarian, because cheese.

PS. Vilnius is a busy city for hosting. Check out also Klaipeda, Kaunas and especially the countryside around! Totally worth it. :-)
