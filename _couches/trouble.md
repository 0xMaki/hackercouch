I have a couch and a fair amount of floor space.  Since I prefer to spend my
time travelling rather than looking after my couch and floor at home, I'm not
home very often.  But I've been known to lend out my apartment to travelling
hackers in my absence.  Get in touch and we can probably work something out!

Check <https://trouble.is/where> for my (rough) whereabouts.
