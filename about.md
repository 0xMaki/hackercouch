HackerCouch is couchsurfing for Hackers. Here's how it goes:

- Fork this repo
- Add your own markdown file with your nick (perhaps twitter/github handle?) in the `_couches` directory
- You file a Pull Request on [github][gh]
- Make sure the build passes
- Go check hackercouch.com the next time you are travelling.

The idea isn't new, it has been tried before as well. The reason I'm trying this again is:

- I love the idea of a Fork->PR->Merge->Publish flow with almost zero effort.
- hackercouch.com was available.

I also made a similar PR-based DNS redirect service called lightsaber recently.
