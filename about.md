HackerCouch is couchsurfing for Hackers. To pledge your couch, you must
file a Pull Request. More detailed instructions are [here][add].

The idea isn't new, it has been [tried before][original] as well. The reason I'm trying this again is:

- I love the idea of a Fork->PR->Merge->Publish flow with almost zero effort.
- hackercouch.com was available.

# Development

HackerCouch uses Jekyll Collections, which is a feature I really like.
Hosted on github-pages, duh.
Builds use travis, and make sure that the site has proper html before its deployed

# Credits

- The original hackercouch project: [jancborchardt/hackercouch][original]
- [remy/mit-license](https://github.com/remy/mit-license) for the fork-PR-publish workflow.

# LICENSE

This uses Jekyll collections and the base Jekyll theme. The very little code here
is licensed under the MIT License. However, everything under the `_couches` directory
is licensed under the CC0 license. If you file a PR to this repo, you agree to having
your "couch information" available under this license.

The minimum required information is your nick, city and country code.
